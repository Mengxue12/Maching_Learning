ML LAB SESSIONS
===============

In every lab session you will find one or more jupyter notebooks in Python
with the session's material.

You can install your own jupyter software in your laptop or use Google Colab.

In order to use Google Colab, you will have to upload the notebooks to your
google drive and open them with Google collaborator. In case this option has not
been used yet, you may have to "install" it by:
Open with -> Connect more apps -> find colaboratory and install.

Once the notebook has been opened, you will have to upload any extra files you
need (data etc.) by dragging them to the folder section (folder icon on the left bar)

If you install jupyter notebook in your own machine, with the terminal you need
to find the directory where the files are located and then type

$ jupyter notebook

This should open a browser window where you can navigate directories and folders.
Once a notebook is open, you can execute/modify/extend it as you wish.
